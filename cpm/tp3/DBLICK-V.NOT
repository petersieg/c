DBLICK-V  In this nicely done version of the venerable video game BREAKOUT
--------  you will attempt, through prodigious paddle use, to keep the ball
          in play and break all the bricks in a multi-layered wall.  Points
          are scored for each brick broken, with the bricks deeper in the wall
          being worth more points than the ones on the surface.

          Move the paddle left with the "," key and right with the "." key.

          At the beginning of each game you will set the skill level from
          1 (slow motion) to 9 (fast forward).  You then select whether or not
          you would like an occasional random jog in the motion of the ball.
          Finally, answer the prompt, "Do you want a paddle with a spacebar
          stop?", with a "Y" or an "N".  If you answer "N" the paddle will
          respond slowly, but will keep moving only as long as the "," or
          "." key is pressed.  When the key is released, the paddle stops.
          This is the best mode to learn in.  When you've become a pro, answer
          "Y".  Now the paddle will move immediately when "," or "." is pressed
          and will keep moving until the spacebar is pressed.

          Be prepared!  As soon as the final prompt is answered, the game will
          begin.

          Of special interest to programmers is the TypeKaypro function.  This
          function examines a port ( 1E ) to determine which type of Kaypro it
          is running on.  TypeKaypro will allow you to write programs which,
          like DBLICK-V, will run on both 83 and 84 model Kaypros.
